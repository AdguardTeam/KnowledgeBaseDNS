You can set it up via [AdGuard](#use-adguard-ad-blocker-paid-option) or [AdGuard VPN](#use-adguard-vpn) apps, in [Windows settings](#configure-via-windows-settings), or using the [AdGuard DNS Client](#use-adguard-dns-client).

## Use AdGuard Ad Blocker (paid option)

The AdGuard app lets you use encrypted DNS, making it perfect for setting up AdGuard DNS on your Windows device. You can choose from various encryption protocols. Along with DNS filtering, you also get an excellent ad blocker that works across your entire system.

1. [Install the app](https://adguard.com/adguard-windows/overview.html) on the device you want to connect to AdGuard DNS.
2. Open the app.
3. Click _Settings_ at the top of the app's home screen.

## Use AdGuard DNS Client

AdGuard DNS Client is a versatile, cross-platform console tool that allows you to connect to AdGuard DNS using encrypted DNS protocols.

More details can be found in [different article](/dns-client/overview/).

## Configure plain DNS

If you prefer not to use extra software for DNS configuration, you can opt for unencrypted DNS. You have two choices: using linked IPs or dedicated IPs.

- [Dedicated IPs](/private-dns/connect-devices/other-options/dedicated-ip.md)
- [Linked IPs](/private-dns/connect-devices/other-options/linked-ip.md)
