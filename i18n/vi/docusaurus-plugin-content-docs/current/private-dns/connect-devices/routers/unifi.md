The UiFi router, commonly known as the Ubiquiti UniFi series, has a number of advantages that make it particularly suitable for home, business, and enterprise environments.

The newer UniFi firmware recently added support for DNS-over-HTTPS. UniFi refers to this feature as _Encrypted DNS_.

## Configure DNS-over-HTTPS

Follow these instructions if your UniFi router supports DNS-over-HTTPS.

UiFi routers use a DNS Stamp URL to specify the DNS-over-HTTPS URL. This URL must be calculated using your private DNS-over-HTTPS URL.

Obtain the DNS-over-HTTPS URL that is used to calculate the DNS Stamp URL.

1. Go to the AdGuard DNS Private Dashboard.
2. Proceed to _Encrypted DNS_ → _Custom_ and enter the following DNS server settings:
    - Device type: 'Router'
    - Device brand: 'Unifi'
    - Device name: Use your Unifi device name
3. Click _Next_.
4. Scroll to _Use DNS server addresses_ → _DNS-over-HTTPS_ and take note of the DNS-over-HTTPS URL (e.g., https://d.adguard-dns.com/dns-query/123456abc).

Generate a DNS stamp using the [DNSCrypt DNS Stamp Calculator](https://dnscrypt.info/stamps/) and set it.

1. Protocol: DNS-over-HTTPS
2. Host name: d.adguard-dns.com
3. Path: /dns-query/123456abc (replace 123456abc with the value obtained from your AdGuard DNS Private Dashboard)
4. Untick
    - No filter
    - No logs
5. Copy the DNS stamp URL (e.g., sdns://AgcAAAAAA…)

Turn on DNS-over-HTTPS in UniFi.

1. Log in to the Ubiquiti UniFi controller.
2. Go to _Settings_ → _Security_.
3. Click _Protection_.
4. Proceed to _Encrypted DNS_ → _Custom_ and enter the following DNS server addresses.
    - Server Name: 'AdGuard DNS'
    - DNS Stamp: DNS stamp URL copied from above
5. Click _Save_.

## Use your router admin panel

Use these instructions if your UniFi router does not support the DNS-over-HTTPS or DNS-over-TLS configuration.

1. Log in to the Ubiquiti UniFi controller.
2. Go to _Settings_ → _Networks_.
3. Click _Edit Network_ → _WAN_.
4. Proceed to _Common Settings_ → _DNS Server_ and enter the following DNS server addresses:
    - IPv4: `94.140.14.49` and `94.140.14.59`
    - IPv6: `2a10:50c0:0:0:0:0:ded:ff` and `2a10:50c0:0:0:0:0:dad:ff`
5. Click _Save_.
6. Return to _Network_.
7. Choose _Edit Network_ → _LAN_.
8. Find _DHCP Name Server_ and select _Manual_.
9. Enter your gateway address in the _DNS Server 1_ field. Alternatively, you can enter the AdGuard DNS server addresses in the _DNS Server 1_ and _DNS Server 2_ fields:
    - IPv4: `94.140.14.49` and `94.140.14.59`
    - IPv6: `2a10:50c0:0:0:0:0:ded:ff` and `2a10:50c0:0:0:0:0:dad:ff`
10. Save the settings.
11. Link your IP (or your dedicated IP if you have a Team subscription).
