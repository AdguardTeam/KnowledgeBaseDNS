## What is Private AdGuard DNS

Private AdGuard DNS is a DNS server that, in addition to benefits of a public DNS server (such as traffic encryption and domain blocklists), provides features like flexible customization, DNS statistics and parental control and is easily managed through a handy dashboard.

## Why Private AdGuard DNS is needed

Today, you can connect anything to the Internet: TVs, refrigerators, smart bulbs, or speakers. But along with the undeniable conveniences you get trackers and ads. A simple browser-based ad blocker will not protect you in this case, but AdGuard DNS, which you can set up to filter traffic, block content and trackers, has a system-wide effect.

We already have [public AdGuard DNS](../public-dns/overview.md) and [AdGuard Home](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome). These solutions work fine for some users, but for others, the public AdGuard DNS lacks the flexibility of configuration, while the AdGuard Home lacks simplicity. That's where private AdGuard DNS comes into play. It has the best of both worlds: it offers customizability, control and information - all through a simple easy-to-use dashboard.

## The difference between Private and Public AdGuard DNS

Here is a simple comparison of features available in Public AdGuard DNS and Private AdGuard DNS servers.

For times when pre-installed *Blocklists* with thousands of rules are not enough, we have a handy function called "User rules".

You can export the lists.
