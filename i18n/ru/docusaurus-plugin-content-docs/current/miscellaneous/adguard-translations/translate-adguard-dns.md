## About AdGuard translation program

When it comes to translations, we at AdGuard always heavily rely on volunteers.

We now use the [Crowdin platform](https://crowdin.com/) to manage translations of our products. So this is the place for anyone who wants to contribute to AdGuard by translating any of our products.

If you want to be among the volunteers who help us translate AdGuard VPN, please read the following information on how to become our translator and how we collaborate with translators.

## How to become a translator

If you want to join AdGuard translators, first of all, go to [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/) and sign up/sign in there.

## Guidelines and recommendations

There are several things we'd like you to know before you start translating. It will not only save your time and effort, but also ensure that we are on the same page in terms of the meaning of the phrases being translated.

1. Pay attention to the glossary terms highlighted with a dotted line in a source phrase. Usually, they are special words (like brand names) that should not be translated.

![Glossary terms](https://cdn.adguard.com/public/Adguard/kb/en/ag-translations/terms_vpn.png)

You can suggest your translation for translatable terms in the [AdGuard Glossary](https://crowdin.com/project/adguard-glossary) project.

2. In Crowdin, strings can have notes to make them easier to understand and translate. Look for them in the "Context" field of the source string.

These are always worth paying attention to. So keep an eye on them.


3. Keep notice of screenshots that often go alongside source phrases in the "context" field as well. They will help to understand the context and convey the exact meaning.

Please note that you can request context by clicking the "REQUEST" button.

![The Request button](https://cdn.adguard.com/public/Adguard/kb/en/ag-translations/request.png)


4. In addition to suggesting new translations, you can also leave comments on strings. Use comments to let us know about mistakes in the existing translations, make notes, or ask questions. If you see a comment left on your translation — try to respond to it.

![Comments on strings](https://cdn.adguard.com/public/Adguard/kb/en/ag-translations/comments.png)


There's also a **Discussions** tab on the main project page that conveniently allows you to see all the comments for the specific language in this project.

![The Discussions tab](https://cdn.adguard.com/public/Adguard/kb/en/ag-translations/discussions.png)


5. Crowdin provides a very useful and convenient tool called _Translation Memory_. With its help, you can find the previously made translations of the same words and phrases and reuse them in your translations.

6. Once you join a project by clicking the "Join" button, you will see the **Tasks** tab on the project page, where the tasks for specific project files get created. _Please pay attention to them: they usually have a higher priority._

![The Tasks tab](https://cdn.adguard.com/public/Adguard/kb/en/ag-translations/tasks.png)


7. Sometimes you can find phrases with plural forms. Please be especially attentive when translating such phrases. You can read how to translate plural forms [here](plural-forms.md).

![Phrases with plural forms](https://cdn.adguard.com/public/Adguard/kb/en/ag-translations/plurals.png)


Using proper plural forms is extremely important: please ask us in the comments if anything is unclear.


8. **Please do not write directly to the project managers listed in the Project info.**

## Proofreaders

We have proofreaders (previously known as moderators) for each language.

What are they responsible for?

**Proofreaders:**

- Approving the high-quality translations and disapproving the bad ones;

- Looking after the relevance of the translations;

- Participating in discussions in the comment section etc.


_As mentioned above, you can ask our proofreaders any questions about translations using comments on Crowdin_.


However, we do hope that everything for you will go smoothly and without any difficulties! Hope to see you on our team!
