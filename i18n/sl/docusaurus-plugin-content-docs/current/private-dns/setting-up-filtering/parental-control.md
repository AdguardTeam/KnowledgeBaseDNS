## What is it

Parental control is a set of settings that gives you the flexibility to customize access to certain websites with sensitive content. You can use this feature to restrict your children’s access to adult sites, customize search queries, block the use of popular services, and more.

## How to set it up

You can flexibly configure all features on your servers, including the parental control feature. [In the corresponding article](private-dns/server-and-settings/server-and-settings.md), you can familiarize yourself with what a server is in AdGuard DNS and learn how to create different servers with different sets of settings.

Then, go to the settings of the selected server and enable the required configurations.

### Blocked services and websites

AdGuard DNS blocks access to popular services with one click. It’s useful if you don’t want connected devices to visit Instagram and YouTube, for example.

### Block websites by category

This feature lets you restrict access to specific categories of websites by choosing from more than 20 categories, including _Adult content_, _Games_, _Banking_, and _Communication_. For example, if you block sites that contain information about alcohol, tobacco, or drugs, the selected device will no longer be able to open pages that fall under those categories.

### Schedule off time

Enables parental controls on selected days with a specified time interval. For example, you may have allowed your child to watch YouTube videos only until 23:00 on weekdays. But on weekends, this access is not restricted. Customize the schedule to your liking and block access to selected sites during the hours you want.
