Game consoles do not support encrypted DNS, but they are well suited for setting up Public AdGuard DNS or Private AdGuard DNS via a linked IP address.

It is likely that your router supports the use of encrypted DNS servers, so you can always configure Private AdGuard DNS on it and connect your game console to it.

[So konfigurieren Sie Ihren Router](/private-dns/connect-devices/routers/routers.md)

## Mit AdGuard DNS verbinden

Configure your game console to use a public AdGuard DNS server or configure it via linked IP:

1. Turn on your Xbox One console and sign in to your account.
2. Press the Xbox button on your controller to open the guide, then select _System_ from the menu.
3. In the _Settings_ menu, select _Network_.
4. Under _Network Settings_, select _Advanced Settings_.
5. Under _DNS Settings_, select _Manual_.
6. In the _DNS Server_ field, enter one of the following DNS server addresses:
   - `94.140.14.49`
   - `94.140.14.59`
7. Speichern Sie die Änderungen.

It would be preferable to use linked IP (or dedicated IP if you have a Team subscription):

- [Dedizierte IPs](/private-dns/connect-devices/other-options/dedicated-ip.md)
- [Verknüpfte IPs](/private-dns/connect-devices/other-options/linked-ip.md)
