## What is AdGuard DNS Client?

A cross-platform lightweight DNS client for [AdGuard DNS][agdns]. It operates as a DNS server that forwards DNS requests to the corresponding upstream resolvers.

[agdns]: https://adguard-dns.io

## Quick start {#start}

:::caution

AdGuard DNS Client is still in the Beta stage. It may be unstable.

:::

Supported operating systems:

- Linux
- macOS
- Windows

Supported CPU architectures:

- 64-bit ARM
- AMD64
- i386

## Getting started {#start-basic}

### Unix-like operating systems {#start-basic-unix}

1. Download and unpack the `.tar.gz` or `.zip` archive from the [releases page][releases].

   :::caution

   On macOS, it's crucial that globally installed daemons are owned by `root` (see the [`launchd` documentation][launchd-requirements]), so the `AdGuardDNSClient` executable must be placed in the `/Applications/` directory or its subdirectory.

   :::

2. Install it as a service by running:

   ```sh
   ./AdGuardDNSClient -s install -v
   ```

3. Edit the configuration file `config.yaml`.

4. Start the service:

   ```sh
   ./AdGuardDNSClient -s start -v
   ```

To check that it works, use any DNS checking utility. For example, using `nslookup`:

```sh
nslookup -debug 'www.example.com' '127.0.0.1'
```

[releases]: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardDNSClient/releases

### Windows {#start-basic-win}

Just download and install using the MSI installer from the [releases page][releases].

To check that it works, use any DNS checking utility. For example, using `nslookup.exe`:

```sh
nslookup -debug "www.example.com" "127.0.0.1"
```

## Command-line options {#opts}

Each option overrides the corresponding value provided by the configuration file and the environment.

### Help {#opts-help}

Option `-h` makes AdGuard DNS Client print out a help message to standard output and exit with a success status-code.

### Service {#opts-service}

Option `-s <value>` specifies the OS service action. Possible values are:

- `install`: installs AdGuard DNS Client as a service
- `restart`: restarts the running AdGuard DNS Client service
- `start`: starts the installed AdGuard DNS Client service
- `status`: shows the status of the installed AdGuard DNS Client service
- `stop`: stops the running AdGuard DNS Client
- `uninstall`: uninstalls AdGuard DNS Client service

### Verbose {#opts-verbose}

Option `-v` enables the verbose log output.

### Version {#opts-version}

Option `--version` makes AdGuard DNS Client print out the version of the `AdGuardDNSClient` executable to standard output and exit with a success status-code.

## Configuration {#conf}

### File {#conf-file}

The YAML configuration file is described in [its own article][conf], and there is also a sample configuration file `config.dist.yaml`.  Some configuration parameters can also be overridden using the [environment][env].

[conf]: configuration.md
[env]: environment.md

## Exit codes {#exit-codes}

There are a few different exit codes that may appear under different error conditions:

- `0`: Successfully finished and exited, no errors.

- `1`: Internal error, most likely a misconfiguration.

- `2`: Bad command-line argument or value.
