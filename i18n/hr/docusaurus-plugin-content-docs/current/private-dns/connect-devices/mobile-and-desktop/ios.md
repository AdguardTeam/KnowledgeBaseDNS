## Use a configuration profile

An iOS device profile, also referred to as a configuration profile by Apple, is a certificate-signed XML file that you can manually install on your iOS device or deploy using an MDM solution. It also allows you to configure Private AdGuard DNS on your device.

:::note Important

If you are using a VPN, the configuration profile will be ignored.

:::

1. Download the profile.
2. Open settings.
3. Tap _Profile Downloaded_.
    ![Profile Downloaded \*mobile_border](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/kb/dns/private/new_dns/connect/ios_manual/manual_step3.png)

## Configure plain DNS

If you prefer not to use extra software to configure DNS, you can opt for unencrypted DNS. There are two options: using linked IPs or dedicated IPs.

- [Dedicated IPs](/private-dns/connect-devices/other-options/dedicated-ip.md)
- [Linked IPs](/private-dns/connect-devices/other-options/linked-ip.md)
