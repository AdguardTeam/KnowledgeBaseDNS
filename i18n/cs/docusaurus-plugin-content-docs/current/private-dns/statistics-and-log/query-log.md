## What is Query log

Query log is a useful tool for working with AdGuard DNS.

It allows you to view all requests made by your devices during the selected time period and sort requests by status, type, company, device, country.

## How to use it

Here's what you can see and what you can do in the _Query log_.

### Detailed information on requests

### Blocking and unblocking domains

Requests can be blocked and unblocked without leaving the log, using the available tools.
