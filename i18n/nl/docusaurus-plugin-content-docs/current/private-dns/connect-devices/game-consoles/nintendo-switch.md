Game consoles do not support encrypted DNS, but they are well suited for setting up Public AdGuard DNS or Private AdGuard DNS via a linked IP address.

It is likely that your router supports the use of encrypted DNS servers, so you can always configure Private AdGuard DNS on it and connect your game console to it.

[How to configure your router](/private-dns/connect-devices/routers/routers.md)

## Connect AdGuard DNS

Configure your game console to use a public AdGuard DNS server or configure it via linked IP:

1. Turn on your Nintendo Switch console and go to the home menu.
2. Go to _System Settings_ â†’ _Internet_.
3. Select the Wi-Fi network that you want to modify the DNS settings for.
4. Click _Change Settings_ for the selected Wi-Fi network.
5. Scroll down and select _DNS Settings_.
6. In the _DNS Server_ field, enter one of the following DNS server addresses:
   - `94.140.14.49`
   - `94.140.14.59`
7. Save your DNS settings.

It would be preferable to use linked IP (or dedicated IP if you have a Team subscription):

- [Gekoppelde IP's](/private-dns/connect-devices/other-options/linked-ip.md)
