Synology NAS routers are incredibly easy to use and can be combined into a single mesh network. You can manage your network remotely anytime, anywhere. You can also configure AdGuard DNS directly on the router.

## Use your router admin panel

Use these instructions if your Keenetic router does not support DNS-over-HTTPS or DNS-over-TLS configuration:

1. Open the router admin panel. It can be accessed at `192.168.1.1` or `192.168.0.1`.
2. Enter the administrator username (usually, itâ€™s admin) and router password.
3. Open _Control Panel_ or _Network_.
4. Select _Network Interface_ or _Network Settings_.
5. Select your Wi-Fi network or wired connection.
6. Choose _Manual DNS_. Select _Use These DNS Servers_ or _Specify DNS Server Manually_ and enter the following DNS server addresses:
   - IPv4: `94.140.14.49` and `94.140.14.59`
   - IPv6: `2a10:50c0:0:0:0:0:ded:ff` and `2a10:50c0:0:0:0:0:dad:ff`
7. Save the settings.
8. Link your IP (or your dedicated IP if you have a Team subscription).
