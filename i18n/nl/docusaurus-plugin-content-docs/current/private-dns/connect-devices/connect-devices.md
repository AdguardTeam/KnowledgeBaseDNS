In this section you will find instructions on how to connect your device to AdGuard DNS and learn about the main features of the service.

- [Android](/private-dns/connect-devices/mobile-and-desktop/android.md)
- [iOS](/private-dns/connect-devices/mobile-and-desktop/ios.md)
- [macOS](/private-dns/connect-devices/mobile-and-desktop/macos.md)
- [Windows](/private-dns/connect-devices/mobile-and-desktop/windows.md)
- [Linux](/private-dns/connect-devices/mobile-and-desktop/linux.md)
- [Routers](/private-dns/connect-devices/routers/routers.md)
- [Game consoles](/private-dns/connect-devices/game-consoles/game-consoles.md)

For devices that do not natively support encrypted DNS protocols, we offer three other options:

- [AdGuard DNS Client](/dns-client/overview.md)
- [Toegewezen IP's](/private-dns/connect-devices/other-options/dedicated-ip.md)
- [Gekoppelde IP's](/private-dns/connect-devices/other-options/linked-ip.md)

If you want to restrict access to AdGuard DNS to certain devices, use [DNS-over-HTTPS with authentication](/private-dns/connect-devices/other-options/doh-authentication.md).

For connecting a large number of devices, there is an [automatic connection option](/private-dns/connect-devices/other-options/automatic-connection.md).
