## What blocklists are

Blocklists are sets of rules in text format that AdGuard DNS uses to filter out ads and content that could compromise your privacy. In general, a filter consists of rules with a similar focus. For example, there may be rules for website languages (such as German or Russian filters) or rules that protect against phishing sites (such as the Phishing URL Blocklist). You can easily enable or disable these rules as a group.

## Why they are useful

Blocklists are designed for flexible customization of filtering rules. For example, you may want to block advertising domains in a specific language region, or you may want to get rid of tracking or advertising domains. Select the blocklists you want and customize the filtering to your liking.

## How to activate blocklists in AdGuard DNS

To activate the blocklists:

1. Open the Dashboard.
2. Go to the _Servers_ section.
3. Select the required server.
4. Click _Blocklists_.

## Adding filters

If you would like the list of AdGuard DNS filters to be expanded, you can submit a request to add them in the relevant section of [Hostlistsregistry](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/HostlistsRegistry) on GitHub.

To submit a request:

1. Go to the link above (you may need to register on GitHub).
2. Click _New issue_.
3. Click _Blocklist request_ and fill out the form.
4. After filling out the form, click _Submit new issue_.

If your filterâ€™s blocking rules do not duplicate the existing lists, it will be added to the repository.

## User rules

You can also create your own blocking rules.
