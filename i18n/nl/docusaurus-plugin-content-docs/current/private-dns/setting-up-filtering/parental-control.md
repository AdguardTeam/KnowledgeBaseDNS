## What is it

Parental control is a set of settings that gives you the flexibility to customize access to certain websites with sensitive content. You can use this feature to restrict your children’s access to adult sites, customize search queries, block the use of popular services, and more.

## How to set it up

You can flexibly configure all features on your servers, including the parental control feature. [In the corresponding article](private-dns/server-and-settings/server-and-settings.md), you can familiarize yourself with what a server is in AdGuard DNS and learn how to create different servers with different sets of settings.

Then, go to the settings of the selected server and enable the required configurations.

### Blocked services and websites

AdGuard DNS blocks access to popular services with one click. It’s useful if you don’t want connected devices to visit Instagram and YouTube, for example.

### Schedule off time

Enables parental controls on selected days with a specified time interval. Je hebt je kind bijvoorbeeld toegestaan om doordeweeks slechts tot 23:00 YouTube-video's te bekijken. But on weekends, this access is not restricted. Customize the schedule to your liking and block access to selected sites during the hours you want.
