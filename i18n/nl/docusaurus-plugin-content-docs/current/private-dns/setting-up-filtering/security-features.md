The AdGuard DNS security settings are a set of configurations designed to protect the user’s personal information.

Here you can choose which methods you want to use to protect yourself from attackers. This will protect you from visiting phishing and fake websites, as well as from potential leaks of sensitive data.

### Block malicious, phishing, and scam domains

To date, we’ve categorized over 15 million sites and built a database of 1.5 million websites known for phishing and malware. Using this database, AdGuard checks the websites you visit to protect you from online threats.

### Block newly registered domains

Scammers often use recently registered domains for phishing and fraudulent schemes. For this reason, we have developed a special filter that detects the lifetime of a domain and blocks it if it was created recently.
Sometimes this can cause false positives, but statistics show that in most cases this setting still protects our users from losing confidential data.

### Kwaadaardige domeinen blokkeren met blokkeerlijsten

AdGuard DNS supports adding third-party blocking filters.
Activate filters marked `security` for additional protection.
