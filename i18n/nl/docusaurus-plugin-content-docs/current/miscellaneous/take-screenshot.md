Screenshot is a capture of your computer’s or mobile device’s screen, which can be obtained by using standard tools or a special program/app.

Sometimes a screenshot (or screenshots) is required by support team to better understand the problem, and not everyone knows how to take screenshots, especially of a separate window or a specific screen area on their devices. If you recognize yourself as one of these users, don’t worry. This article will help you as it describes a range of ways to take screenshots on different platforms.

## How to take a screenshot

Here you will find all the necessary hotkeys you should know in order to take screenshots on your computer or mobile device.

### Android

Taking a screenshot on an Android device can be done in various ways — depending on the device model and its manufacturer.

Over het algemeen kan de volgende knoppencombinatie voor Android worden gebruikt:

- **Houd de knoppen *Volume omlaag* en *Aan/uit* tegelijkertijd 1-2 seconden ingedrukt**

Your Android device will capture the entire screen and save it as a photo. So, you can find the screenshot in a Screenshots folder in your Gallery.

Zoals eerder vermeld, kan de procedure echter variëren afhankelijk van het specifieke apparaat. Let’s look at other possible combinations:

- **Houd de knoppen *Startscherm* en *Aan/uit* tegelijkertijd 1-2 seconden ingedrukt;**
- **Houd de knoppen *Terug* en *Startscherm* tegelijk ingedrukt**

Op Android 8 en hoger kan ook een schermafbeelding worden gemaakt door de rand van een open hand verticaal langs de linker-/rechterschermrand te plaatsen en de hand naar de andere schermrand te vegen terwijl je het scherm met de handrand aanraakt.

If this method doesn’t work, check *Settings* → *Advanced* features to enable *Palm swipe to capture*.

Bovendien kun je altijd speciale toepassingen gebruiken om schermafbeeldingen op jouw apparaten te maken, bijvoorbeeld - *Screenshot Easy*, *Screenshot Ultimate*, *Screenshot Snap*, enz.

### iOS

Any iOS device (barring ancient ones) lets you take a screenshot using standard tools.

To take a screenshot on an iOS device, use the following combination:

- **Press the *Sleep/Wake* (side) button and the *Home* button at the same time, then quickly release them**

and this one for iPhone X or later:

- **Press the *Sleep/Wake* button and the *Volume up* button at the same time, then quickly release them**

Your iOS device will capture the entire screen and save it as a photo. You can find it in a standard Photo app.

### Windows

- **To take a screenshot on Windows, press the *PrtScn* button**

On some notebooks you have to hold *Fn* and then press *PrtScn* instead.

*Please note: PrtScn (Print Screen) button can be differently abbreviated on various keyboards — PrntScrn, PrtScn, PrtScr or PrtSc.*

Windows captures the entire screen and copies it to the clipboard.

To take a screenshot of an active window, use the following combination:

- **Hold down *Alt* and press *PrtScn* (or *Fn + Alt + PrtScn* on some laptops)**

To take a screenshot of a specific area, you should use the following combination:

- ***Hold down *Win* (the Windows button) and *Shift* and press ***S******

After you take a screenshot, it will be saved in the clipboard. In most cases you will be able to paste it into a document that you are currently editing by using *Ctrl + V* button combination. Alternatively, if you need to save the screenshot into a file, you should open the standard **Paint** program (or any other app that can work with images). Paste your screenshot there using the same button combination or by clicking the Paste button (usually in the top left corner of the screen) and then save it.

Windows 8 and 10 let you take a screenshot very quickly with a *Win + PrtScn* combination. As soon as you press these buttons, the screenshot will be automatically saved as a file to your Pictures → Screenshots Folder.

There is also a dedicated program for taking screenshots called *Snipping Tool* that you can find via Start menu among standard programs of your computer. Snipping Tool lets you capture of any area of your desktop or the entire screen. After taking a screenshot using this program you can edit the picture and save it to any folder on your computer.

Bovendien kun je ook proberen verschillende apps te gebruiken voor het maken van schermafbeeldingen op jouw computer, zoals **PicPick**, **Nimbus Screenshot**, **Screenshot Captor**, **Snipaste**, **Monosnap**, enz.

### MacOS

To take a screenshot on Mac, use the following button combination:

- ***Press and hold together ***⌘ Cmd + Shift + 3******

Your Mac will capture the entire screen and save it as a file on the desktop.

To take a screenshot of an active window, use the following combination:

- **Press and hold together *⌘ Cmd + Shift + 4 + Space bar*.  The pointer will change to a camera icon. Click the window to capture it. Press the Esc button to cancel taking a screenshot**

To take a screenshot of a specific area, you should use the following combination:

- ***Press and hold together ***⌘ Cmd + Shift + 4******. Drag the crosshair to select the needed area. Release your mouse or trackpad to take a screenshot, press the Esc button to cancel it.

To take a screenshot of the *Touch Bar* (MacBook Pro) use the following combination:

- ***Hold down ***⌘ Cmd + Shift + 6******

Your Mac captures the entire *Touch Bar* and saves it as a file on the desktop.

To copy a screenshot to the clipboard instead of saving it, hold down *Ctrl* together with any of the combinations above. Then you can paste the screenshot (from the clipboard) into a document or an image you are currently editing by using *Cmd + V* combination.

You can also take screenshots by using **Preview** and choosing **Take screenshot** (of the selected area, window, or the entire screen). With **Preview** you can save your screenshots in JPG, TIFF, PDF, and other file formats.
