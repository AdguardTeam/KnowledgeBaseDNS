## What is a server and how to use it

When you set up Private AdGuard DNS, you’ll encounter the term _servers_.

A server acts as the “profile” that you connect your devices to.

Servers include configurations that you can customize to your liking.

Upon creating an account, we automatically establish a server with default settings. You can choose to modify this server or create a new one.

For instance, you can have:

- A server that allows all requests
- A server that blocks adult content and certain services
- A server that blocks adult content only during specific hours you choose

For more information on traffic filtering and blocking rules, check out the [_How to set up filtering in AdGuard DNS_](/private-dns/setting-up-filtering/setting-up-filtering.md) section.

If you’re interested in specific settings, there are dedicated articles available for that:

- [Access settings](/private-dns/server-and-settings/access.md)
- [Rate limit](/private-dns/server-and-settings/rate-limit.md)
- [Role-based access](/private-dns/server-and-settings/role-based-access.md)
