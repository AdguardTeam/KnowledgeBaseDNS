One of the purposes of using AdGuard DNS is to have a clear understanding of what your devices are doing and what they are connecting to. Without this clarity, there's no way to monitor the activity of your devices.

AdGuard DNS provides a wide range of useful tools for monitoring queries:

- [Statistics](/private-dns/statistics-and-log/statistics.md)
- [Traffic destination](/private-dns/statistics-and-log/traffic-destination.md)
- [Companies](/private-dns/statistics-and-log/companies.md)
- [Query log](/private-dns/statistics-and-log/query-log.md)
