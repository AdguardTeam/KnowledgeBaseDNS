## What is Private AdGuard DNS?

<iframe width="560" height="315" class="youtube-video" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ME3_Ms9LO8M" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In addition to the benefits of a public DNS server (such as traffic encryption and domain blocklists), Private AdGuard DNS provides features like flexible customization, DNS statistics, and parental control, and is easily managed through a handy dashboard.

## Why you need Private AdGuard DNS

Today, you can connect anything to the Internet: TVs, refrigerators, smart bulbs, or speakers. But along with the undeniable conveniences you get trackers and ads. A simple browser-based ad blocker will not protect you in this case, but AdGuard DNS, which you can set up to filter traffic, block content and trackers, has a system-wide effect.

We already have [public AdGuard DNS](../public-dns/overview.md) and [AdGuard Home](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome). These solutions work fine for some users, but for others, the public AdGuard DNS lacks the flexibility of configuration, while the AdGuard Home lacks simplicity. That's where private AdGuard DNS comes into play. It has the best of both worlds: it offers customizability, control and information - all through a simple easy-to-use dashboard.

## The difference between Private and Public AdGuard DNS

Here is a simple comparison of features available in Public AdGuard DNS and Private AdGuard DNS servers.

## How to set up Private AdGuard DNS

1. Go to your [AdGuard DNS dashboard](https://agrd.io/download-dns) (if not logged in, log in using your AdGuard account)
1. Click "Connect device" and follow on-screen instructions

:::note Supported platforms:

- Android
- iOS
- Windows
- Mac
- Linux
- Routers
- Gaming consoles
- Smart TVs

:::

Every device that you add in the AdGuard DNS panel has its own unique address that can be used if the device supports modern encrypted DNS protocols (DoH, DoT, and DoQ).

## Linked IP

If the device does not support encrypted DNS and you have to use plain DNS, there's another way to allow AdGuard DNS to recognize the device — link its IP address. In this case AdGuard DNS counts all plain DNS requests that come from that IP address towards that "device".

The only requirement for linking IP is that **it must be a residential IP address**.

:::note

A residential IP address is an IP address assigned to a device connected to a residential ISP. It is typically associated with a physical location and is allocated to individual homes or apartments. Residential IP addresses are used by regular Internet users for their everyday online activities, such as browsing the web, accessing social media platforms, sending emails, or streaming content.

:::

If you're trying to link a residential IP address and AdGuard DNS does not allow you to do that, please contact our support team at support@adguard.com.

## Private AdGuard DNS features

### User rules

For times when pre-installed *Blocklists* with thousands of rules are not enough, we have a handy function called "User rules". Here you can add custom rules manually to block/unblock a certain domain or import custom rules lists (check out [DNS filtering rules syntax](../general/dns-filtering-syntax.md)). You can export the lists.
