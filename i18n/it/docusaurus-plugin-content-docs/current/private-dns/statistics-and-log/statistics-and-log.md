One of the purposes of using AdGuard DNS is to have a clear understanding of what your devices are doing and what they are connecting to. Without this clarity, there's no way to monitor the activity of your devices.

AdGuard DNS fornisce un ampio intervallo di strumenti utili per il monitoraggio delle richieste:

- [Statistics](/private-dns/statistics-and-log/statistics.md)
- [Traffic destination](/private-dns/statistics-and-log/traffic-destination.md)
- [Companies](/private-dns/statistics-and-log/companies.md)
- [Registro delle query](/private-dns/statistics-and-log/query-log.md)
