This tab allows you to quickly see which companies send the most requests and which companies have the most blocked requests.

The Companies page is divided into two categories:

- **Top requested company**
- **Top blocked company**

These are further divided into sub-categories:

- **Advertising**: advertising and other ad-related requests that collect and share user data, analyze user behavior, and target ads
- **Trackers**: requests from websites and third parties for the purpose of tracking user activity
- **Social media**: requests to social network websites
- **CDN**: request connected to Content Delivery Network (CDN), a worldwide network of proxy servers that speeds the delivery of content to end users
- **Other**

### Top companies

In this table, we not only show the names of the most visited or most blocked companies, but also display information about which domains are being requested from or which domains are being blocked the most.
