## Cos'è il registro delle richieste

Il registro delle richieste è uno strumento utile per lavorare con AdGuard DNS.

It allows you to view all requests made by your devices during the selected time period and sort requests by status, type, company, device, country.

## How to use it

Ecco cosa puoi vedere e cosa puoi fare nel _registro delle richieste_.

### Blocking and unblocking domains

Requests can be blocked and unblocked without leaving the log, using the available tools.

You can select the status of the request, its type, company, device, and the time period of the request you are interested in.
