OPNSense firmware is often used to configure wireless access points, DHCP servers, DNS servers, allowing you to configure AdGuard DNS directly on the device.

## Use your router admin panel

Use these instructions if your Keenetic router does not support DNS-over-HTTPS or DNS-over-TLS configuration:

1. Open the router admin panel. It can be accessed at `192.168.1.1` or `192.168.0.1`.
2. Enter the administrator username (usually, itâ€™s admin) and router password.
3. Click _Services_ in the top menu, then select _DHCP Server_ from the drop-down menu.
4. On the _DHCP Server_ page, select the interface that you want to configure the DNS settings for (e.g., LAN, WLAN).
5. Scroll down to _DNS Servers_.
6. Choose _Manual DNS_. Select _Use These DNS Servers_ or _Specify DNS Server Manually_ and enter the following DNS server addresses:
    - IPv4: `94.140.14.49` and `94.140.14.59`
    - IPv6: `2a10:50c0:0:0:0:0:ded:ff` and `2a10:50c0:0:0:0:0:dad:ff`
7. Save the settings.
8. Optionally, you can enable DNSSEC for enhanced security.
9. Link your IP (or your dedicated IP if you have a Team subscription).
