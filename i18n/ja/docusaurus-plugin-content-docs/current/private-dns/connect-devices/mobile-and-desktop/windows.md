## Use AdGuard DNS Client

AdGuard DNS Client is a versatile, cross-platform console tool that allows you to connect to AdGuard DNS using encrypted DNS protocols.

More details can be found in [different article](/dns-client/overview/).

## Configure plain DNS

If you prefer not to use extra software for DNS configuration, you can opt for unencrypted DNS. You have two choices: using linked IPs or dedicated IPs.
