2. Open the app.
3. Click the icon in the top right corner.

1. Install the [AdGuard VPN app](https://adguard-vpn.com/mac/overview.html) on the device you want to connect to AdGuard DNS.
2. Open the AdGuard VPN app.
3. Open _Settings_ → _App settings_ → _DNS servers_ → _Add Custom Server_.

## Use a configuration profile

A macOS device profile, also referred to as a "configuration profile" by Apple, is a certificate-signed XML file that you can manually install on your device or deploy using an MDM solution. It also allows you to configure Private AdGuard DNS on your device.

:::note Important

If you are using a VPN, the configuration profile will be ignored.

:::

1. On the device that you want to connect to AdGuard DNS, download the configuration profile.
2. Choose Apple menu → _System Settings_, click _Privacy & Security_ in the sidebar, then click _Profiles_ on the right (you may need to scroll down).

## Configure plain DNS

If you prefer not to use extra software for DNS configuration, you can opt for unencrypted DNS. You have two choices: using linked IPs or dedicated IPs.

- [リンクされたIP](/private-dns/connect-devices/other-options/linked-ip.md)
