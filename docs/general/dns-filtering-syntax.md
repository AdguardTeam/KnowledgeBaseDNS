##  Introduction

You can use AdGuard DNS filtering rules syntax to make the rules more flexible, so they can block content according to your preferences.
AdGuard DNS filtering rules syntax can be used in different AdGuard products such as AdGuard Home, AdGuard DNS, AdGuard for Windows/Mac/Android.

There are three different approaches to writing hosts blocklists:

 *  [Adblock-style syntax](#adblock-style-syntax): the modern approach to writing
    filtering rules based on using a subset of the Adblock-style rule syntax.
    This way blocklists are compatible with browser ad blockers.

 *  [`/etc/hosts` syntax](#etc-hosts-syntax): the old, tried-and-true approach that
    uses the same syntax that operating systems do for their hosts files.

 *  [Domains-only syntax](#domains-only-syntax): a simple list of domain names.

If you are creating a blocklist for AdGuard Home, we recommend using the
[Adblock-style syntax](#adblock-style-syntax). It has a couple of important advantages
over the old-style syntax:

 *  **Blocklists size.**  Using pattern matching allows you to have a single
    rule instead of hundreds of `/etc/hosts` entries.

 *  **Compatibility.**  Your blocklist will be compatible with browser ad
    blockers, and it will be easier to share rules with a browser filter list.

 *  **Extensibility.**  For the last decade the Adblock-style syntax has greatly
    evolved, and we don't see why we can't extend it even more and provide
    additional features for network-wide blockers.

If you're maintaining an `/etc/hosts`-style blocklist or if you maintain
multiple filter lists regardless of their type, we provide a tool that can be
used to compile blocklists for AdGuard Home.  We called it [Hostlist
compiler][hlc] and we use it ourselves to create [AdGuard DNS filter][sdn].

##  Basic Examples

 *  `||example.org^`: block access to the `example.org` domain and all its
    subdomains, like `www.example.org`.

 *  `@@||example.org^`: unblock access to the `example.org` domain and all its
    subdomains.

 *  `1.2.3.4 example.org`: (attention, old `/etc/hosts`-style syntax) respond
    with `1.2.3.4` to queries for the `example.org` domain but **not** its
    subdomains.  `www.example.org` remains allowed.

    Using the unspecified IP address (`0.0.0.0`) or a local address (`127.0.0.1`
    and alike) for a host is basically the same as blocking that host.

    ```none
    # Returns the IP address 1.2.3.4 for example.org.
    1.2.3.4 example.org
    # Blocks example.com by responding with 0.0.0.0.
    0.0.0.0 example.com
    ```

 *  `example.org`: a simple domain rule.  Blocks `example.org` domain but
    **not** its subdomains.  `www.example.org` remains allowed.

 *  `! Here goes a comment` and `# Also a comment`: comments.

 *  `/REGEX/`: block access to the domains matching the specified regular
    expression



##  Adblock-Style Syntax

This is a subset of the [traditional Adblock-style][adb] syntax which is used by
browser ad blockers.

```none
     rule = ["@@"] pattern [ "$" modifiers ]
modifiers = [modifier0, modifier1[, ...[, modifierN]]]
```

 *  `pattern`: the hostname mask.  Every hostname is matched against this mask.
    The pattern can also contain special characters, which are described below.

 *  `@@`: the marker that is used in the exception rules.  Start your rule with
    this marker if you want to turn off filtering for the matching hostnames.

 *  `modifiers`: parameters that clarify the rule.  They may limit the scope of
    the rule or even completely change the way it works.

   ###  Special Characters

 *  `*`: the wildcard character.  It is used to represent any set of characters.
    This can also be an empty string or a string of any length.

 *  `||`: matches the beginning of a hostname, including any subdomain.  For
    instance, `||example.org` matches `example.org` and `test.example.org` but
    not `testexample.org`.

 *  `^`: the separator character.  Unlike browser ad blocking, there's nothing
    to separate in a hostname, so the only purpose of this character is to mark
    the end of the hostname.

 *  `|`: a pointer to the beginning or the end of the hostname.  The value
    depends on the character placement in the mask.  For example, the rule
    `ample.org|` corresponds to `example.org` but not to `example.org.com`.
    `|example` corresponds to `example.org` but not to `test.example`.

   ###  Regular Expressions

If you want even more flexibility in making rules, you can use [regular
expressions][regexp] instead of the default simplified matching syntax.  If you
want to use a regular expression, the pattern has to look like this:

```none
pattern = "/" regexp "/"
```

**Examples:**

 *  `/example.*/` will block hosts matching the `example.*` regexp.

 *  `@@/example.*/$important` will unblock hosts matching the `example.*`
    regexp.  Note that this rule also implies the `important` modifier.

   ###  Comments

Any line that starts with an exclamation mark or a hash sign is a comment and it
will be ignored by the filtering engine.  Comments are usually placed above
rules and used to describe what a rule does.

**Example:**

```none
! This is a comment.
# This is also a comment.
```

   ###  Rule Modifiers

You can change the behavior of a rule by adding modifiers.  Modifiers must be
located at the end of the rule after the `$` character and be separated by
commas.

**Examples:**

 *  ```none
    ||example.org^$important
    ```

    `||example.org^` is the matching pattern.  `$` is the delimiter, which
    signals that the rest of the rule are modifiers.  `important` is the
    modifier.

 *  You may want to use multiple modifiers in a rule.  Separate them by commas
    in this case:

    ```none
    ||example.org^$client=127.0.0.1,dnstype=A
    ```

    `||example.org^` is the matching pattern.  `$` is the delimiter, which
    signals that the rest of the rule are modifiers.  `client=127.0.0.1` is the
    [`client`](#client) modifier with its value, `127.0.0.1`, is the delimiter.
    And finally, `dnstype=A` is the [`dnstype`](#dnstype) modifier with its
    value, `A`.

**NOTE:**  If a rule contains a modifier not listed in this document, the whole
rule **must be ignored**.  This way we avoid false-positives when people are
trying to use unmodified browser ad blockers' filter lists like EasyList or
EasyPrivacy.

  ####  `client`

The `client` modifier allows specifying clients this rule is applied to.  There
are two main ways to identify a client:

 *  By their IP address or CIDR prefix.  This way works for all kinds of
    clients.

 *  By their name.  This way only works for persistent clients, that is clients
    which you have manually added on the “Settings → Client settings” page.

    **NOTE:** ClientIDs are not currently supported, only names are.  If you
    have added a client with the name “My Client” and ClientID `my-client`,
    spell your modifier as `$client='My Client'` as opposed to
    `$client=my-client`.

The syntax is:

```none
$client=value1|value2|...
```

You can also exclude clients by adding a `~` character before the value.  In
this case, the rule is not be applied to this client's DNS requests.

```none
$client=~value1
```

Client names usually contain spaces or other special characters, which is why
you should enclose the name in quotes.  Both single and double ASCII quotes are
supported.  Use the backslash (`\`) to escape quotes (`"` and `'`), commas
(`,`), and pipes (`|`).

**NOTE:** When excluding a client, you **must** keep `~` out of the quotes.

**Examples:**

 *  `@@||*^$client=127.0.0.1`: unblock everything for localhost.

 *  `||example.org^$client='Frank\'s laptop'`: block `example.org` for the
    client named `Frank's laptop` only.  Note that quote (`'`) in the name must
    be escaped.

 *  `||example.org^$client=~'Mary\'s\, John\'s\, and Boris\'s laptops'`: block
    `example.org` for everyone except for the client named `Mary's, John's, and
    Boris's laptops`.  Note that comma (`,`) must be escaped as well.

 *  `||example.org^$client=~Mom|~Dad|Kids`: block `example.org` for `Kids`, but
    not for `Mom` and `Dad`.  This example demonstrates how to specify multiple
    clients in one rule.

 *  `||example.org^$client=192.168.0.0/24`: block `example.org` for all clients
    with IP addresses in the range from `192.168.0.0` to `192.168.0.255`.

  ####  `denyallow`

Available since **v0.106.0**.

You can use the `denyallow` modifier to exclude domains from the blocking rule.
To add multiple domains to one rule, use the `|` character as a separator.

The syntax is:

```none
$denyallow=domain1|domain2|...
```

This modifier allows avoiding creating unnecessary exception rules when our
blocking rule covers too many domains.  You may want to block everything save
for a couple of TLD domains. You could use the standard approach, i.e. rules
like this:

```none
! Block everything.
/.*/

! Unblock a couple of TLDs.
@@||com^
@@||net^
```

The problem with this approach is that this way you will also unblock tracking
domains that are located on those TLDs (i.e. `google-analytics.com`).  Here's
how to solve this with `denyallow`:

```none
*$denyallow=com|net
```

**Examples:**

 *  `*$denyallow=com|net`: block everything save for `*.com` and `*.net`.

 *  `@@*$denyallow=com|net`: unblock everything save for `*.com` and `*.net`.

 *  `||example.org^$denyallow=sub.example.org`. block `example.org` and
    `*.example.org` but don't block `sub.example.org`.

  ####  <a href="#dnstype" id="dnstype" name="dnstype">`dnstype`</a>

Available since **v0.105.0**.

The `dnstype` modifier allows specifying DNS request or response type on which
this rule will be triggered.

The syntax is:

```none
$dnstype=value1|value2|...
$dnstype=~value1|~value2|~...
```

The names of the types are case-insensitive, but are validated against a set of
actual DNS resource record (RR) types.

Do not combine exclusion rules with inclusion ones.  This:

```none
$dnstype=~value1|value2
```

is equivalent to this:

```none
$dnstype=value2
```

**Examples:**

 *  `||example.org^$dnstype=AAAA`: block DNS queries for the IPv6 addresses of
    `example.org`.

 *  `||example.org^$dnstype=~A|~CNAME`: only allow `A` and `CNAME` DNS queries
    for `example.org`, block out the rest.

**NOTE:** Before version **v0.108.0,** AdGuard Home would use the type of the
request to filter the response records, as opposed to the type of the response
record itself.  That caused issues, since that meant that you could not write
rules that would allow certain `CNAME` records in responses in `A` and `AAAA`
requests.  In **v0.108.0** that behaviour was changed, so now this:

```none
||canon.example.com^$dnstype=~CNAME
```

allows you to avoid filtering of the following response:

```none
ANSWERS:
->  example.com
    canonical name = canon.example.com.
    ttl = 60
->  canon.example.com
    internet address = 1.2.3.4
    ttl = 60
```

  ####  `dnsrewrite`

Available since **v0.105.0**.

The `dnsrewrite` response modifier allows replacing the content of the response
to the DNS request for the matching hosts.  Rules with the `dnsrewrite`
response modifier have higher priority than other rules in AdGuard Home.

The shorthand syntax is:

```none
$dnsrewrite=1.2.3.4
$dnsrewrite=abcd::1234
$dnsrewrite=example.net
$dnsrewrite=REFUSED
```

The keywords MUST be in all caps (e.g. `NOERROR`).  Keyword rewrites take
precedence over the other and will result in an empty response with an
appropriate response code.

Before **v0.107.3** the only possible keyword is `REFUSED`.

Since **v0.107.3** response codes `NOERROR`, `NXDOMAIN`, and `SERVFAIL` are also
supported.

The full syntax is of the form `RCODE;RRTYPE;VALUE`:

```none
$dnsrewrite=NOERROR;A;1.2.3.4
$dnsrewrite=NOERROR;AAAA;abcd::1234
$dnsrewrite=NOERROR;CNAME;example.net
$dnsrewrite=REFUSED;;
```

Since **v0.107.3** a `$dnsrewrite` modifier with the `NOERROR` response code may
also has empty `RRTYPE` and `VALUE` fields.

The `CNAME` one is special because AdGuard Home will resolve the host and add
its info to the response.  That is, if `example.net` has IP `1.2.3.4`, and the
user has this in their filter rules:

```none
||example.com^$dnsrewrite=example.net
! Or:
||example.com^$dnsrewrite=NOERROR;CNAME;example.net
```

then the response will be something like:

```sh
$ nslookup example.com my.adguard.local
```

```none
Server:		my.adguard.local
Address:	127.0.0.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:
example.com	canonical name = example.net.
Name:	example.net
Address: 1.2.3.4
```

Next, the `CNAME` rewrite.  After that, all other records's values are summed as
one response, so this:

```none
||example.com^$dnsrewrite=NOERROR;A;1.2.3.4
||example.com^$dnsrewrite=NOERROR;A;1.2.3.5
```

will result in a response with two `A` records.

Currently supported RR types with examples:

 *  `||4.3.2.1.in-addr.arpa^$dnsrewrite=NOERROR;PTR;example.net.` adds a `PTR`
    record for reverse DNS.  Reverse DNS requests for `1.2.3.4` to the
    AdGuard Home DNS server will result in `example.net`.

    **NOTE:** the IP MUST be in reverse order.  Before **v0.106.0**, the value
    had to contain a final dot, but since **v0.106.0** both forms are accepted.
    See [RFC 1035][rfc1035].

 *  `||example.com^$dnsrewrite=NOERROR;A;1.2.3.4` adds an `A` record with the
    value `1.2.3.4`.

 *  `||example.com^$dnsrewrite=NOERROR;AAAA;abcd::1234` adds an `AAAA` record
    with the value `abcd::1234`.

 *  `||example.com^$dnsrewrite=NOERROR;CNAME;example.org` adds a `CNAME` record.
    See explanation above.

 *  `||example.com^$dnsrewrite=NOERROR;HTTPS;32 example.com alpn=h3` adds an
    `HTTPS` record.  Only a subset of parameter values is supported: values must
    be `contiguous` and, where a `value-list` is expected`, only one value is
    currently supported:

    ```none
    ipv4hint=127.0.0.1             // Supported.
    ipv4hint="127.0.0.1"           // Unsupported.
    ipv4hint=127.0.0.1,127.0.0.2   // Unsupported.
    ipv4hint="127.0.0.1,127.0.0.2" // Unsupported.
    ```

    This will change in the future.

 *  `||example.com^$dnsrewrite=NOERROR;MX;32 example.mail` adds an `MX` record
    with precedence value `32` and exchange value `example.mail`.

 *  `||example.com^$dnsrewrite=NOERROR;SVCB;32 example.com alpn=h3` adds and
    `SVCB` value.  See the `HTTPS` example above.

 *  `||example.com^$dnsrewrite=NOERROR;TXT;hello_world` adds a `TXT` record with
    the value `hello_world`.

 *  `||_svctype._tcp.example.com^$dnsrewrite=NOERROR;SRV;10 60 8080 example.com`
    adds an `SRV` record with priority value `10`, weight value `60`, port
    `8080`, and target value `example.com`.

 *  `||example.com^$dnsrewrite=NXDOMAIN;;` responds with an `NXDOMAIN` code.

 *  `$dnstype=AAAA,denyallow=example.org,dnsrewrite=NOERROR;;` responds with an
    empty `NOERROR` answers for all `AAAA` requests except the ones for
    `example.org`.

    **NOTE:** this is available since **v0.107.3**.

Exception rules remove one or all rules:

 *  `@@||example.com^$dnsrewrite` removes all DNS rewrite rules.

 *  `@@||example.com^$dnsrewrite=1.2.3.4` removes the DNS rewrite rule that adds
    an `A` record with the value `1.2.3.4`.

  ####  <a href="#important" id="important" name="important">`important`</a>

The `important` modifier applied to a rule increases its priority over any
other rule without the modifier.  Even over basic exception rules.

**Examples:**

 *  In this example:

    ```none
    ||example.org^$important
    @@||example.org^
    ```

    `||example.org^$important` will block all requests to `*.example.org`.
    despite the exception rule.

 *  In this example:

    ```none
    ||example.org^$important
    @@||example.org^$important
    ```

    the exception rule also has the `important` modifier, so it will work.

  ####  `badfilter`

The rules with the `badfilter` modifier disable other basic rules to which they
refer.  It means that the text of the disabled rule should match the text of the
`badfilter` rule (without the `badfilter` modifier).

**Examples:**

 *  `||example.com$badfilter` disables `||example.com`.

 *  `@@||example.org^$badfilter` disables `@@||example.org^`.

**NOTE:**  The `badfilter` modifier currently doesn't work with
`/etc/hosts`-style rules.  `127.0.0.1 example.org$badfilter` will **not**
disable the original `127.0.0.1 example.org` rule.

  #### `ctag`

The `ctag` modifier allows to block domains only for specific types of DNS
client tags.  You can assign tags to clients in the AdGuard Home UI.  In the
future, we plan to assign tags automatically by analyzing the behavior of each
client.

The syntax is:

```none
$ctag=value1|value2|...
```

If one of client's tags matches the `ctag` values, this rule applies to the
client.  The syntax for exclusion is:

```none
$ctag=~value1|~value2|...
```

If one of client's tags matches the exclusion `ctag` values, this rule doesn't
apply to the client.

**Examples:**

* `||example.org^$ctag=device_pc|device_phone`: block `example.org` for clients
  tagged as `device_pc` or `device_phone`.

* `||example.org^$ctag=~device_phone`: block `example.org` for all clients
  except those tagged as `device_phone`.

The list of allowed tags:

 *  By device type:

     *  `device_audio`: audio devices.
     *  `device_camera`: cameras.
     *  `device_gameconsole`: game consoles.
     *  `device_laptop`: laptops,
     *  `device_nas`: NAS (Network-attached Storages).
     *  `device_pc`: PCs.
     *  `device_phone`: phones.
     *  `device_printer`: printers.
     *  `device_securityalarm`: security alarms.
     *  `device_tablet`: tablets.
     *  `device_tv`: TVs.
     *  `device_other`: other devices.

 *  By operating system:

     *  `os_android`: Android.
     *  `os_ios`: iOS.
     *  `os_linux`: Linux.
     *  `os_macos`: macOS.
     *  `os_windows`: Windows.
     *  `os_other`: other OSes.

 *  By user group:

     *  `user_admin`: administrators.
     *  `user_regular`: regular users.
     *  `user_child`: children.

##  `/etc/hosts`-Style Syntax {#etc-hosts-syntax}

For each host a single line should be present with the following information:

```none
IP_address canonical_hostname [aliases...]
```

Fields of the entries are separated by any number of space or tab characters.
Text from the `#` character until the end of the line is a comment and is
ignored.

Hostnames may contain only alphanumeric characters, hyphen-minus signs (`-`),
and periods (`.`).  They must begin with an alphabetic character and end with an
alphanumeric character.  Optional aliases provide for name changes, alternate
spellings, shorter hostnames, or generic hostnames (for example, `localhost`).

**Example:**

```none
# This is a comment
127.0.0.1 example.org example.info
127.0.0.1 example.com
127.0.0.1 example.net # this is also a comment
```

The IP addresses are used to respond to the DNS queries for these domains.


##  Domains-Only Syntax

A simple list of domain names, one name per line.

Example:

```none
# This is a comment
example.com
example.org
example.net # this is also a comment
```

If a string is not a valid domain (e.g. `*.example.org`), AdGuard Home will
consider it to be an [Adblock-style](#adblock-style-syntax) rule.

##  Hostlists Compiler

If you are maintaining a blocklist and use different sources in it, [Hostlists
compiler][hlc] may be useful to you.  It is a simple tool that makes it easier
to compile a hosts blocklist compatible with AdGuard Home or any other AdGuard
product with DNS filtering.

What it's capable of:

1.  Compile a single blocklist from multiple sources.

2.  Exclude the rules you don't need.

3.  Cleanup the resulting list: deduplicate, remove invalid rules, and compress
    the list.
