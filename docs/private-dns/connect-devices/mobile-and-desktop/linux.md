## Use AdGuard DNS Client

AdGuard DNS Client is really great, [learn more about it](/dns-client/overview).

## Configure manually on Debian (Linked IP или Dedicated IP required)

## Use dnsmasq

If you prefer not to use extra software for DNS configuration, you can opt for unencrypted DNS. You have two choices: using linked IPs or dedicated IPs.

- [Dedicated IPs](/private-dns/connect-devices/other-options/dedicated-ip.md)
- [Linked IPs](/private-dns/connect-devices/other-options/linked-ip.md)
