1. Open the AdGuard app.

## Use a configuration profile

An iOS device profile, also referred to as a "configuration profile" by Apple, is a certificate-signed XML file that you can manually install on your iOS device or deploy using an MDM solution. It also allows you to configure Private AdGuard DNS on your device.

> If you are using a VPN, the configuration profile will be ignored.

1. [Download](https://dns.website.agrd.dev/public_api/v1/settings/e7b499cc-94c0-4448-8404-88d11f4f51a2/doh_mobileconfig.xml) profile.
1. Open settings.
1. Tap *Profile Downloaded*.

## Configure plain DNS

If you prefer not to use extra software to configure DNS, you can opt for unencrypted DNS. There are two options: using linked IPs or dedicated IPs.

- [Dedicated IPs](/private-dns/connect-devices/other-options/dedicated-ip.md)
- [Linked IPs](/private-dns/connect-devices/other-options/linked-ip.md)
