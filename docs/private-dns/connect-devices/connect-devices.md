In this section you will find instructions on how to connect your device to AdGuard DNS and learn about the main features of the service.

- [Android](/mobile-and-desktop/android.md)
- [iOS](/mobile-and-desktop/ios.md)
- [MacOS](/mobile-and-desktop/macos.md)
- [Windows](/mobile-and-desktop/windows.md)
- [Linux](/mobile-and-desktop/linux.md)
- [Routers](/routers/routers.md)
- [Gaming consoles](/gaming-consoles/gaming-consoles.md)

For devices that do not natively support encrypted DNS protocols, we offer three other options:

- [AdGuard DNS Client](/other-options/client.md)
- [Dedicated IPs](/other-options/dedicated-ip.md)
- [Linked IPs](/other-options/linked-ip.mds)

If you want to restrict access to AdGuard DNS to certain devices, use [DNS-over-HTTPS with authentication](/other-options/doh-authentication.md).

For connecting a large number of devices, there is an [automatic connection option](/other-options/automatic-connection.md).
