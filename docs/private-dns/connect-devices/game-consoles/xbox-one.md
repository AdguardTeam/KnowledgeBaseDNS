Game consoles do not support encrypted DNS, but they are well suited for setting up Public AdGuard DNS or Private AdGuard DNS via a linked IP address.

It is likely that your router supports the use of encrypted DNS servers, so you can always configure Private AdGuard DNS on it and connect your game console to it.

[How to configure your router](/private-dns/connect-devices/routers/routers.md)

## Connect AdGuard DNS

Configure your game console to use a public AdGuard DNS server or configure it via linked IP:

1. Turn on your Xbox One console and sign in to your account.
1. Press the Xbox button on your controller to open the guide, then select *System* from the menu.
1. In the *Settings* menu, select *Network*.
1. Under *Network Settings*, select *Advanced Settings*.
1. Under *DNS Settings*, select *Manual*.
1. In the *DNS Server* field, enter one of the following DNS server addresses:
    - `94.140.14.49`
    - `94.140.14.59`
1. Save the changes.

It would be preferable to use linked IP (or dedicated IP if you have a Team subscription):

- [Linked IPs](/private-dns/connect-devices/other-options/linked-ip.md)
