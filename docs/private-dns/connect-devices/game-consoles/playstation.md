It is likely that your router supports the use of encrypted DNS servers, so you can always configure Private AdGuard DNS on it and connect your game console to it.

You can find instructions on how to configure your router in [this section](/private-dns/connect-devices/routers/routers.md).

## Connect AdGuard DNS

Configure your game console to use a public AdGuard DNS server or configure it via linked IP:

1. Turn on your PS4/PS5 console and sign in to your account.

1. From the home screen, select the gear icon located in the top row.

1. In the Settings menu, select Network.

1. Select Set Up Internet Connection.

1. Choose Use Wi-Fi or Use a LAN Cable, depending on your network setup.

1. Select Custom and then select Automatic for IP Address Settings.

1. For DHCP Host Name, select Do Not Specify.

1. For DNS Settings, select Manual.

1. In the DNS Server field, enter one of the following DNS server addresses:

    94.140.14.49

    94.140.14.59

1. Select Next to continue.

1. On the MTU Settings screen, select Automatic.

1. On the Proxy Server screen, select Do Not Use.

1. Select Test Internet Connection to test your new DNS settings.

1. Once the test is complete and you see Internet Connection: Successful, save your settings.

It would be preferable to use linked IP (or link your Dedicated IP if you're using a team subscription)
