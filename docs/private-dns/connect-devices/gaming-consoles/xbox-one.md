It is likely that your router supports the use of encrypted DNS servers, so you can always configure Private AdGuard DNS on it and connect your game console to it.

You can find instructions on how to configure your router in [this section](/private-dns/connect-devices/routers/routers.md).

## Connect AdGuard DNS

Configure your game console to use a public AdGuard DNS server or configure it via linked IP:

1. Turn on your Xbox One console and sign in to your account.

1. Press the Xbox button on your controller to open the guide, and then select System from the menu.

1. In the Settings menu, select Network.

1. Under Network settings, select Advanced settings.

1. Under DNS settings, select Manual.

1. In the DNS Server field, enter one of the following DNS server addresses:

    94.140.14.49

    94.140.14.59

1. Save the changes.

It would be preferable to use Linked IP (Or link your Dedicated IP if you're using a team subscription)

- [Linked IPs](/private-dns/connect-devices/other-options/linked-ip.md)
