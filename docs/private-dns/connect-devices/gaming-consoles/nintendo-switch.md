It is likely that your router supports the use of encrypted DNS servers, so you can always configure Private AdGuard DNS on it and connect your game console to it.

You can find instructions on how to configure your router in [this section](/connect-devices/routers/routers.md).

## Connect AdGuard DNS

Configure your game console to use a public AdGuard DNS server or configure it via linked IP:

1. Turn on your Nintendo Switch console and go to the Home Menu.

1. Go to System Settings â†’ Internet.

1. Select the Wi-Fi network that you want to modify the DNS settings for.

1. Click Change Settings for the selected Wi-Fi network.

1. Scroll down and select DNS Settings.

1. In the DNS Server field, enter one of the following DNS server addresses:

    94.140.14.49

    94.140.14.59

1. Save your DNS settings.

It would be preferable to use Linked IP (Or link your Dedicated IP if you're using a team subscription)
