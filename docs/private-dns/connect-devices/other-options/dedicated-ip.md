## What are dedicated IPs?

Dedicated IPv4 addresses are available to users with Team and Enterprise subscriptions.

Blah blah blah.

## Why do you need a dedicated IP?

Unfortunately, the technical specifications of the connected device may not always allow you to set up an encrypted private AdGuard DNS server. In this case, users will have to use standard unencrypted DNS. There are two ways to set up AdGuard DNS: [using linked IPs](/private-dns/connect-devices/other-options/linked-ip.md) and using dedicated IPs.

The instructions below explain how to connect a dedicated IP to the device:

## Connect AdGuard DNS using dedicated IPs

1. Open Dashboard.
1. Add a new device or open the settings of a previously created device.
1. Select *Use server addresses*.
