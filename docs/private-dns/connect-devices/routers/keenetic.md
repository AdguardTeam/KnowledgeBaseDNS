## Use your router admin panel

Use these instructions if your Keenetic router does not support DNS-over-HTTPS or DNS-over-TLS configuration:

1. Open the router admin panel. It can be accessed at 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1.

Alternatively you can opt for unencrypted DNS. You have two choices: using linked IPs or dedicated IPs.
