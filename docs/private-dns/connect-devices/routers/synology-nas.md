Synology NAS routers are incredibly easy to use and can be combined into a single mesh network. You can manage your network remotely anytime, anywhere. You can also configure AdGuard DNS directly on the router.

## Use your router admin panel

Use these instructions if your Keenetic router does not support DNS-over-HTTPS or DNS-over-TLS configuration:

1. Open the router admin panel. It can be accessed at 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1.

1. Enter the administrator username (usually, itâ€™s admin) and router password.

1. Open Control Panel or Network.

1. Further instructions.

Alternatively you can opt for unencrypted DNS. You have two choices: using linked IPs or dedicated IPs.

- [Dedicated IPs](/connect-devices/other-options/dedicated-ip.md)
- [Linked IPs](/connect-devices/other-options/linked-ip.md)
