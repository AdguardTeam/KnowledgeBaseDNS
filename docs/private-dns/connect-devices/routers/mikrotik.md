MikroTik routers use the open source RouterOS operating system, which provides routing, wireless networking and firewall services for home and small office networks.

## Configure DNS-over-HTTPS

1. Access your MikroTik router:

    - Open your web browser and go to your router's IP address (usually 192.168.88.1)
    - Alternatively, you can use Winbox to connect to your MikroTik router
    - Enter your administrator username and password

1. Further instructions.

## Use your router admin panel

Use these instructions if your Keenetic router does not support DNS-over-HTTPS or DNS-over-TLS configuration:

1. Open the router admin panel. It can be accessed at 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1.

1. Enter the administrator username (usually, it’s admin) and router password.

1. Open Webfig → IP → DNS.

Alternatively you can opt for unencrypted DNS. You have two choices: using linked IPs or dedicated IPs.

- [Dedicated IPs](/private-dns/connect-devices/other-options/dedicated-ip.md)
- [Linked IPs](/private-dns/connect-devices/other-options/linked-ip.md)
