OPNSense firmware is often used to configure wireless access points, DHCP servers, DNS servers, allowing you to configure AdGuard DNS directly on the device.

## Use your router admin panel

Use these instructions if your Keenetic router does not support DNS-over-HTTPS or DNS-over-TLS configuration:

1. Open the router admin panel. It can be accessed at 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1.

1. Enter the administrator username (usually, itâ€™s admin) and router password.

1. Click Services in the top menu, then select DHCP Server from the drop-down menu.

1. Further instructions.

Alternatively you can opt for unencrypted DNS. You have two choices: using linked IPs or dedicated IPs.

- [Dedicated IPs](/connect-devices/other-options/dedicated-ip.md)
- [Linked IPs](/connect-devices/other-options/linked-ip.md)
