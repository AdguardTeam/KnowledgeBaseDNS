FRITZ!Box provides maximum flexibility for all devices by simultaneously using the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands. All devices connected to the FRITZ!Box are fully protected against attacks from the Internet. The configuration of this brand of routers also allows you to set up encrypted Private AdGuard DNS.

## Configure DNS-over-TLS

1. Open the router admin panel. It can be accessed at fritz.box, the IP address of your router, or 192.168.178.1.

1. Enter the administrator username (usually, it’s admin) and router password.

1. Open Internet or Home Network.

1. Further instructions.

## Use your router admin panel

Use this guide if your FritzBox router does not support DNS-over-TLS configuration:

1. Open the router admin panel. It can be accessed at 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1.

1. Enter the administrator username (usually, it’s admin) and router password.

1. Open Internet or Home Network.

Alternatively you can opt for unencrypted DNS. You have two choices: using linked IPs or dedicated IPs.

- [Dedicated IPs](/private-dns/connect-devices/other-options/dedicated-ip.md)
- [Linked IPs](/private-dns/connect-devices/other-options/linked-ip.md)
