By configuring Access settings, you can protect your AdGuard DNS from unauthorized access. For example, you are using a dedicated IPv4 address, and attackers using sniffers have recognized it and are bombarding it with requests. No problem, just add the pesky domain or IP address to the list and it won't bother you anymore!

Blocked requests will not be displayed in the Query Log and are not counted in the total limit.

## How to set it up

- **Allowed clients.** This allows you to specify which clients can use your DNS server.

> This setting has the highest priority. For example, if the same IP address is on both the denied and allowed list, it will still be allowed.

- **Disallowed clients.** A beautiful description.

- **Disallowed domains.** A beautiful description.
