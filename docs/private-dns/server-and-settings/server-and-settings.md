## What is server and how to use it

When you set up Private AdGuard DNS, you'll encounter the term *servers*.

A server acts as the "profile" that you connect your devices to.

Servers include configurations that you can customize to your liking.

Upon creating an account, we automatically establish a server with default settings. You can choose to modify this server or create a new one.

For instance, you can have:

1. A server that allows all requests.

1. A server that blocks adult content and certain services.

1. A server that blocks adult content only during specific hours you choose.

For more information on traffic filtering and blocking rules, check out the article ["How to set up filtering in AdGuard DNS"](/private-dns/setting-up-filtering/blocklists.md).

If you're interested in specific settings, there are dedicated articles available for that:

- [Access settings](/private-dns/server-and-settings/access.md)
