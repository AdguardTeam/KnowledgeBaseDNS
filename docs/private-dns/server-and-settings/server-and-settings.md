## What is server and how to use it

When you set up a private AdGuard DNS, you'll come across the term "Servers."

A server acts as the "profile" that you connect your devices to.

Servers include configurations that you can customize to your liking.

When you create an account, we automatically set up a server with default settings. You can either customize this server or create a new one.

For instance, you can have:

1. A server that allows all requests.

1. A server that blocks adult content and certain services.

1. A server that blocks adult content only during specific hours you choose.

Blah blah blah.

You can read more about traffic filtering and blocking rules in the article ["How to set up filtering in AdGuard DNS"](/private-dns/setting-up-filtering/blocklists.md).

If you are interested in settings, there are separate articles for that:

- [Advanced settings](/private-dns/server-and-settings/advanced.md)
- [Access settings](/private-dns/server-and-settings/access.md)
