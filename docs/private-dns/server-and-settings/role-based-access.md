With role-based access, account owners can invite members with specific roles to manage DNS without sharing credentials. Each member logs in individually, ensuring a secure and efficient workflow in collaborative environments.

:::note

This feature is available for **Business** accounts with a **Team** or **Enterprise** subscription.

## Types of members

DNS accounts support three access levels. Ownership is fixed at registration, while **admins** and **viewers** are added through invitations. Roles can be updated or revoked at any time, and the number of members is virtually unlimited.

- **Owner**: the account holder with full access to all settings and billing

- **Admin**: a member who can modify DNS settings, manage devices, and invite other members. Best for system administrators or MSPs responsible for network filtering in organizations. With a single login, admins can manage several accounts and switch between them quickly

- **Viewer**: a member with read-only access. Can view settings and statistics but cannot make changes. Best for consultants or managers who monitor network activity and provide recommendations without modifying DNS settings
