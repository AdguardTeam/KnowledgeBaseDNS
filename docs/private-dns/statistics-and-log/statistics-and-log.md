One of the purposes of using AdGuard DNS is to have a clear understanding of what your devices are doing and what they are connecting to. Without this clarity, there's no way to monitor the activity of your devices.

AdGuard DNS provides a wide range of useful tools for monitoring queries:

- [Statistics](/statistics.md)
- [Traffic destination](/traffic-destination.md)
- [Companies](/companies.md)
- [Query log](/query-log.md)
