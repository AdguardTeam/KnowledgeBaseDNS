This tab allows you to quickly see which companies send the most requests and which companies have the most blocked requests.

The Companies page is divided into two categories:

- **Top requested company**
- **Top blocked company**

These are further divided into sub-categories:

- Advertising (The Advertising category includes ads and other ad-related requests that collect and share user data, analyze user behavior, and target ads)
- Trackers (requests from websites and third parties to track user activity)
- Social media (requests to social networking sites)
- CDN (Content Delivery and Distribution Network is a worldwide network of proxy servers that speeds up the delivery of content)
- Other

### Top companies

In this table, we not only show the names of the most visited or most blocked companies, but also display information about which domains are being requested from or which domains are being blocked the most.
