Recently created websites can be dangerous: fraudsters often use them to trick people into entering card details or downloading malware.

With the release of version 2.4, AdGuard DNS now has the *Block newly registered domains* feature. Activate it to block all domains registered less than 30 days ago.

You can find this feature in Server settings: *Security* â†’ *Block newly registered domains*.
