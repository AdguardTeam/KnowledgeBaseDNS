The goal of this Knowledgebase is to provide everyone with the most up-to-date information on all kinds of AdGuard DNS-related topics. But things constantly change, and sometimes an article doesn't reflect the current state of things anymore — there are simply not so many of us to keep an eye on every single bit of information and update it accordingly when new versions are released. 

This is why we placed all of our KB content to [GitHub](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/KnowledgeBaseDNS), and now literally anyone can contribute to it by suggesting edits and translations to existing articles, as well as totally new ones. 

## How to suggest a change or write a new article
 
You can suggest changes to current articles and add new ones to the Knowledgebase VPN using the functionality of the GitHub mentioned above.
If you are unfamiliar with principles of working with the platform, start by reading [articles in this section](https://docs.github.com/en).
 
Once you are ready to start, work in [the KnowledgeBaseDNS repository](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/KnowledgeBaseDNS). Alter articles using [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) in any source-code editor you like. 
 
> The Knowledgebase DNS website is buit using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/docs/category/guides) — a modern static website generator. You can use its functionality to build a site from documents placed locally on your computer.

## Translating an article

To make the process of translating the AdGuard DNS Knowledge Base articles more convenient, [we moved it to Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/adguard-knowledge-bases)! If you are not familiar with this platform and are not registered on it, [go to this article](/miscellaneous/adguard-translations/translate-adguard-dns.md) for more information on the topic. 

## Working on open issues

Sometimes there's need to update or complement an existing article, or create a new one, but we can't do it right away for some reason. In such cases usually a task ("issue") gets created in special repository on GitHub. You can get there by [this link](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/KnowledgeBaseDNS/issues/), choose any issue that you find appealing and start working on it. If you have any questions — you can ask them right in the comments to that issue.
